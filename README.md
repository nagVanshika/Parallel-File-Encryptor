# Parallel-File-Encryptor
Author- Vanshika Nag
 This project is a command-line based parallel file encryptor. It reads a large input file, splits it into smaller fixed-size
 chunks, and assigns each chunk to a separate process. Each process encrypts its part independently. This parallel
 approach significantly reduces the time taken to encrypt large files compared to doing it sequentially
